# Game name
A console game project part of Telerik Academy teamwork.
## Project Description

The project represents a console game called “Hell Quiz” written in the C# programming language. The game is similar to the popular “Falling Rocks”, but offers a unique user experience. It tests your common knowledge, skills and instinct of self-preservation.

## Gameplay

First, you receive a question in the upper part of the console. To answer this question, you have to collect falling letters in particular order. These letters have to form the right word, which is the answer of the question. All the letters, falling in the console, are part of the desired answer. If you catch a letter at a wrong position in the word, you can delete it by catching a “backspace” symbol (<). If you collect a word, which is not answering the question, you will lose one of your lives. In case of everything is right and the question is answered, you will gain an extra life, 10 points for every single letter of the word and then continue to the next question. You can change the question if you are not sure about the answer. You should be aware that not only friendly letters exist on the console. There are a lot of bombs (&) you have to avoid to save your life. Enjoy the game!
